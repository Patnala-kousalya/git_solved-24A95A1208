# System Architecture

## Overview
DevOps Simulator uses a containerized microservices architecture designed for high availability and observability. Services run in containers (Kubernetes by default) and are delivered via automated CI/CD pipelines.

## 




### Application
- Runtime: Node.js + Express (containerized)
- Config: PORT and other settings via environment variables
- Health checks: liveness & readiness endpoints for orchestration
- Scaling: Horizontal autoscaling (HPA) based on CPU/memory or custom metrics
- Observability: structured logs, OpenTelemetry traces

### Database
- Engine: PostgreSQL (version pinned)
- Topology: primary-replica (read replicas) with documented automated/manual failover
- Connection pooling: PgBouncer or similar
- Backups: scheduled automated backups, retention policy, and periodic restore tests
- Encryption: TLS in-transit and encryption-at-rest enabled
- DR targets: RTO/RPO defined in runbooks

### Networking & Ingress
- Ingress: API Gateway / Load Balancer with TLS termination and rate limiting
- Service discovery: Kubernetes DNS or service mesh
- Network policies: enforce least privilege between services

### Security
- Secrets: centralized secrets manager (Vault / Azure Key Vault) or K8s secrets with envelope encryption
- Access control: RBAC for cluster and service accounts
- Dependency management: automated scanning and PRs for security updates
- Auditing: enable audit logs for privileged ops

### Observability & Alerting
- Metrics: Prometheus with scrape configs and Grafana dashboards
- Logging: centralized logging (ELK / Loki)
- Tracing: Jaeger or OTEL collector
- Alerts: Alertmanager â†’ Slack / PagerDuty / email with runbooks linked
- SLOs: defined per service, documented error budgets and escalation paths

## Deployment & CI/CD
- CI: lint, unit/integration tests, image build
- CD: automated deployments (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / ArgoCD)
- Strategies: rolling updates by default; canary or blue-green for high-risk changes
- Rollback: automated rollback criteria on failed health checks; explicit rollback runbooks

## Operations & Runbooks
- Runbooks: documented procedures for DB failover, restore, scaling, incident response
- Maintenance: scheduled windows and upgrade policy
- DR drills: periodic disaster recovery tests and post-mortems
- Cost control: resource requests/limits and autoscaling policies

## Notes & Best Practices
- Replace "master-slave" terminology with "primary-replica".
- Document environment-specific configs (dev/stage/prod) and pin runtime versions.
- Include readiness/liveness, connection pooling, secret rotation, and backup retention in operational docs.
